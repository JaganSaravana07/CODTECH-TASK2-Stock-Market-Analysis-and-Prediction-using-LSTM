# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM - Stocks[Tesla, Netflix, Meta, Nvidia]

## Description

The financial markets are characterized by their inherent volatility and unpredictability, making accurate predictions a challenging task. In recent years, advancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promise in forecasting stock prices. This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stock market trends using LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data. The project leverages historical stock data to build a predictive model, aiming to assist investors in making informed decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model using LSTM networks to forecast stock prices accurately. By answering the following key questions, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding and actionable insights into stock market movements:

1. **What was the change in price of the stock over time?**

Analyze the historical price movements of stocks to understand the trends and fluctuations over a specified period.
2. **What was the daily return of the stock on average?**

Calculate the average daily return of stocks to assess the performance and volatility of individual stocks.
3. **What was the moving average of the various stocks?**

Compute the moving averages of different stocks to identify the overall direction of the market and smooth out short-term fluctuations.
4. **What was the correlation between different stocks?**

Determine the correlation between various stocks to understand how the prices of different stocks move in relation to each other, which can aid in portfolio diversification.
5. **How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?**

Assess the value at risk (VaR) to estimate the potential loss in value of an investment over a specified period under normal market conditions.
6. **How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?**

Utilize LSTM networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, providing a predictive model that investors can use to make more informed investment decisions.
This project aims to bridge the gap between complex deep learning models and practical financial applications, offering a reliable tool for investors to enhance their decision-making process.
